  <p class="big-letter">I started playing flute in my elementary school band program in 5th grade. Originally, the choice of instrument was made purely out of convenience:  my mother had played flute when she was in school,  so I could use her old flute instead of renting one. One thing led to another and now it's what I do.</p>
